During screening, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is just one of 2 we tested that consists of an external siren, and we're satisfied that it likewise includes a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further preventing anyone from attempting to break in to your residential or commercial property.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
