<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
