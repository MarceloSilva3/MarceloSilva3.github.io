<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
