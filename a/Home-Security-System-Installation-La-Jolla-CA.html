<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
