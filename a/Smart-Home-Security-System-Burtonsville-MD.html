<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
