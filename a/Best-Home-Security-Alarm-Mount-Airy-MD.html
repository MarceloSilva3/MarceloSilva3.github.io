Arlo says that the system utilizes three layers of encryption, with limited Web access on the Base Station and no local gain access to on the camera or the Base Station.

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>I ask forgiveness to all the Wink fans out there, however to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch.

Rather, you turn notifies on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or trigger the siren.
