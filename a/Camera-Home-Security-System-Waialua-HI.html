<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and reduce criminal activity. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this evaluation. Basically, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
