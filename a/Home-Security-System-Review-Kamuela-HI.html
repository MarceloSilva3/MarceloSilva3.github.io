<p>Home security systems and contemporary clever home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to use their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Try to find a design that provides a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety approximately 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for taped video.
