Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage area rapidly.
