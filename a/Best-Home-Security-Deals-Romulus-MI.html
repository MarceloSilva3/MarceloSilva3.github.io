<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
