<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was developed for house owners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, when installed, is tough to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big residential or commercial properties and are typically more expensive than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera similar to the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to rework the existing wires in your house. If you've currently set up a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system, the team will be able to reuse the existing wiring. Nevertheless, if this is your very first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
