<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
