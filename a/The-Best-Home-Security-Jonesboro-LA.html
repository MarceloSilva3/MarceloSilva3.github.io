In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we may review this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.
