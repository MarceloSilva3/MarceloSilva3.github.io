<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
