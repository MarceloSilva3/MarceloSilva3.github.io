<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensors and smart-home parts in your house.

<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing.
