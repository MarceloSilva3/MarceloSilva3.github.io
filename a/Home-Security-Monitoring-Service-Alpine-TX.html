<p>Alarm monitoring is part of a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically incredibly high decibel so that you can hear it as can next-door neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with an expert monitoring company. The control panel interacts with the other parts of the system, consisting of the cameras, doors and window sensors, and motion sensing units, to discover an intruder or something that is incorrect. Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, connecting with you and alerting the authorities.</p>

If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you will not need to worry about it taping or sending out an alert whenever the pet dog strolls by. (We think this is a more valuable feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the membership makes this camera smarter, it's terrific that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Web cam.</p>

However, you will have to pay for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this does not come with expert monitoring.
