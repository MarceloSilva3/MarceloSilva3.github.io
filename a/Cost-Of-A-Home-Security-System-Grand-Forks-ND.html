<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop.
