And that rate jumps a lot when you include wise cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can choose from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, but every smart camera Blue deals is $200.</p>
<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, however the white and black version can in fact be clearer and offer you higher-quality video.

The camera can tape-record video in as much as 1080p, which looks completely fine on a smartphone screen and won't tax your internet connection excessive. Netatmo likewise permits you to tweak the settings for each individual user - for example, do not tape Abbie, but do record Ben. It's in fact quite smart.</p>
