<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
