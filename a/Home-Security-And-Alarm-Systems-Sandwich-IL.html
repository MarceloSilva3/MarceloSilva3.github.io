<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Going into the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
