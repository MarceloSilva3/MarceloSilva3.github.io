If you add monitoring, costs will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you dedicate to a three-year agreement. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 each month and does not require a contract.</p>
