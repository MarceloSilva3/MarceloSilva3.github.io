The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the malicious enemy to record these codes and use different cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key captured during the network healing.</p>
