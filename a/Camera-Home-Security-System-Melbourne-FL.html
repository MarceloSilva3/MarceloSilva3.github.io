We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
