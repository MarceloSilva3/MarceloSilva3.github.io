<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
