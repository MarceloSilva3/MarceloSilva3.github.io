The infrared energy released by a things is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding small distinctions in temperature level.

Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
