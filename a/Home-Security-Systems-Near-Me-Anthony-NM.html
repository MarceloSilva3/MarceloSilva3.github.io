<p>Possible customers may find ADT's pricing plan to be disagreeable: it's difficult to find clear info on costs on the company's site, and you will not have a concept of your security system's cost until a service technician comes to your home and prepares a proposal. You can be sure that it will be high, though, combined with the necessary 3-year agreement and regular monthly professional monitoring charge.
