<h2>Home Security Camera Systems Ashland</h2>

Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in many cases, entirely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives due to the fact that their design enables minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is much better to have actually a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. This will provide more precise and less frequent signals because many times the motion detection is triggered by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
