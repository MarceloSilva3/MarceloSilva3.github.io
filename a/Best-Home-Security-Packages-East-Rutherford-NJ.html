<p>ALARM USER. Anybody, firm, association or corporation of any kind in control of any structure, structure or center wherein an alarm is installed, run and kept. In the case of an occupancy, the occupant will be considered the sole alarm user at the alarm site. The other significant decision when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an outdoor or indoor camera. Outdoor cameras will typically be constructed to be more durable and able to survive rain, frost, or damp. The disadvantage of outdoor cameras is that they're generally mains powered and require expert installation.</p>
<p>Are independently owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is enjoying you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same individual might put a surveillance camera then remotely view a person within the privacy of their home.
