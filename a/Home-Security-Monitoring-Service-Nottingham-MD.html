<p>Destructive actors won't be able to access your router's privacy settings from a device not linked to your wireless network once you turned off the remote access. I feel this is a low-cost way to go if you don't desire monitored name brand alarm systems. This in addition to backyard indications and window stickers (offered on Amazon) may be enough to prevent small time scoundrels. The security offering we are explaining here-- which was at first flagged to us by a reader-- falls under that general banner, and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepage.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
