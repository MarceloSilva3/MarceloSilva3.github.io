Not just is the Arlo fast to choose moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple decades back, the home security industry was controlled by a few huge names providing pricey, rigid plans with little versatility and hostile, long-lasting agreements.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
