<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
