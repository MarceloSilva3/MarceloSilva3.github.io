<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for renters are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike house owners, usually avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also allow remote control of the system and general home automation.

With many Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any month-to-month charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you devote to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus strategy goes for $10 monthly and does not require an agreement.</p>
