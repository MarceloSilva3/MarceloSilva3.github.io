<p>Honeywell's DIY security system counts on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It works as the brains of the system, connecting with sensing units and third party-devices by means of Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. Another area where Arlo stands out is customer service. After long-term testing this camera because we first made it a pick in 2016, we discovered that our Arlo Q started predicting a pink tint, which appears to be a continuous issue for some owners.

<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems normally do not included upfront fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
