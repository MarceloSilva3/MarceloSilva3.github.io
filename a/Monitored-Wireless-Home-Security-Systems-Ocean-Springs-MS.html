The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their reactions. Outdoor cameras are among the very best ways to deter (and catch) intruders, vandals, and other rascals.

<p>There's no devoted hub involved here - each camera links straight to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a cool option, or a minimum of one that saves a power socket and an Ethernet port, however we can't help however feel it's also the factor for the Swann's slightly sluggish reaction times.
