<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

As soon as we got a sufficient look at those friendly faces, we tilted the whole collection outward for another two weeks to see what type of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is approximately 50 feet away.</p>
