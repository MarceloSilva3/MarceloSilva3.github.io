<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
