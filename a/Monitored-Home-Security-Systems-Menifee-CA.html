The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix detail after the truth, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of recording storage area. So much, in fact, that they require about four times the hard disk area of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. Be prepared to spend more money if extended video storage is very important.</p>
