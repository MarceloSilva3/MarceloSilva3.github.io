<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a total home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically exceptionally high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company. The control board communicates with the other parts of the system, including the cameras, window and door sensing units, and motion sensors, to detect an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company instantly sets to action, getting in touch with you and alerting the authorities.</p>
