The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers bring into question the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or 4 totally free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
