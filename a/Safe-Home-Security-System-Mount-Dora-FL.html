<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the obligation of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to keep and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage area quickly.
