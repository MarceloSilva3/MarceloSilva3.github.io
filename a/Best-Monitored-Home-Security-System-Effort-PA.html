<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower crime. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, conserving the last 5 days of video footage to the cloud.
