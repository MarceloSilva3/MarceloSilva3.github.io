<p>Discover how to develop, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and decrease criminal activity. The Ring Floodlight Webcam integrates two necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it switches on its 2 powerful LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Webcam also has a loud speaker, so you can talk to whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions.
