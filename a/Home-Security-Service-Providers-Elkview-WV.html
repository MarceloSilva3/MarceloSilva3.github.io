<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building.

Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
