The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
