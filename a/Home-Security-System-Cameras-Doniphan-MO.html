This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
