<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it discovered any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would require to be a perfect storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as conclusive, we believe this problem is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>

<p>Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control board does need to be set up by a expert and linked  to a power source.

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
