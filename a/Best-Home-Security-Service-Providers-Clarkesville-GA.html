<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening.

Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
