<h3>Best Burglar Alarm Coos Bay OR 97420</h3>
<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to innovative smart home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
