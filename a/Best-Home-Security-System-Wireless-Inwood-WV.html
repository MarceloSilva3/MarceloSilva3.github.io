SimpliSafe responded with a statement saying the system would notify users when it found any kind of disturbance. The company likewise questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be a perfect storm of circumstances for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern.
