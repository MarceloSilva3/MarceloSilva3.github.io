The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller sized, however the range is better, appealing connections to wireless sensors up to 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to tackle 40 feet in various instructions, through walls to locations in the cooking area and dining-room.

However, there are effective countermeasures (like disabling open switchports during switch setup and VLAN configuration to limit network gain access to) that are available to secure both the network and the details it contains, however such countermeasures need to be applied evenly to all network gadgets.</p>
