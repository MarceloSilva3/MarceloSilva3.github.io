<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
