A few designs utilize batteries, making placement more versatile, but this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi protection also impacts where you position a camera: If you wish to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to mount the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
