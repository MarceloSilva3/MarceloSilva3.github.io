<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your family and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This system is what interacts with all of the security sensors and smart-home elements in your house. Numerous connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, placement is more flexible. When they open, contact sensors are the very first thing you should buy along with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will notify you. Other home security parts include motion sensing units, keypads, crucial fobs, cameras, glass-break sensors, and panic buttons.</p>
<p>Almost all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet goes down or your power goes out, your security system will still work. However, there are still some wireless home security systems that use an internet connection as their main interaction source. Most internet linked security systems feature a battery backup, which means if the power goes out your alarm will still work for a minimal amount of time. But, if your web goes down, sadly, you will lack an alarm system up until it comes back up.</p>

<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
