<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational worth. It gets an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.
