No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
