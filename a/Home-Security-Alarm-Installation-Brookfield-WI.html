It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep video footage in your area on an SD card.
