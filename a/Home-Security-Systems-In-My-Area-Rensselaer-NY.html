<p>Various kinds of CCTV cameras. While burglar alarm technology has developed substantially considering that the 19th century, it is still based upon the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell.

If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can only enjoy one.

We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
