<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, indicating you will not be able to connect it directly to other third-party gadgets like wise locks or automate specific actions in the home.

But these combinations aren't rather as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>
<p>Lots of home security systems are controlled by mobile phones and that trend will continue. Systems will have less wall-mounted keypads, and instead, give more controls to more gadgets.

Wired alarm systems are incredibly trusted and you do not need to worry about their battery going out.
