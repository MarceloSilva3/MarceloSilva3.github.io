<h3>Alarm Systems For The Home in Beaverton MI</h3>

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart too much. Pretty simple to install.
