<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
