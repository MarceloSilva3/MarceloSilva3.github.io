<p>Nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. Audio and video confirmation strategies use cameras and microphones to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image snapshots. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, typically an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the main station where screens recover the images through proprietary software. The information is then relayed to law enforcement and tape-recorded to an event file, which can be utilized to prepare a more strategical and tactical technique of a residential or commercial property, and later on as prosecution proof.</p>

<p>Another method to keep recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a gadget is similar in performance to a PC with a capture card and appropriate video recording software Unlike PCs, most DVRs created for CCTV functions are embedded gadgets that require less upkeep and simpler setup than a PC-based solution, for a medium to a a great deal of analogue cameras.
