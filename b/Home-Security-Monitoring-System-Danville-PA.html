<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

DVR systems are tough to scale up because when every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to purchase a completely new DVR before including another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the linked cameras be in close distance to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
