<h2>Focus On What Matters Most Wellford</h2>

Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, generally via 110VAC power.</p>
