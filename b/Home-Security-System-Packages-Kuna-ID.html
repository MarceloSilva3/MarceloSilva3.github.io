<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus scams, vandalism, and theft. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive false alarms.

If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
