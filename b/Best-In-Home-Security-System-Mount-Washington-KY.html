Get a full image of the crucial locations other cameras can't reach. The wireless, weather-resistant Arlo Go uses LTE and your mobile plan to go anywhere untethered.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
