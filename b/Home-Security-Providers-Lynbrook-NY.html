For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make clients stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>While not a necessary requirement for a home security system, all top companies use a variety of camera options as add-ons. Property owners can select from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape-record video footage when an alarm is activated, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, nanny cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be integrated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic knowledge of alarm systems is valuable. Although there are a variety of additional system parts offered consisting of smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm includes three main components: a keypad control board, private sensors, and a manned monitoring station.</p>

Wired security systems are connected by hard-wired cable televisions and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to place and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, utilize a WiFi connection, are quick to set up, and can be placed anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based on two unshielded (or 'dripping') coax cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength weakens due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is created. The system is covert after installation. Care should be required to guarantee the surrounding soil provides good drain in order to avoid annoyance alarms.</p>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can deal with such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom.
