<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
