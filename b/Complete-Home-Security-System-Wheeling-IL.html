The Angee is short on functions and huge on running costs. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro often displayed green and pink lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera continuously flickered in the evening; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a confusing app.</p>
