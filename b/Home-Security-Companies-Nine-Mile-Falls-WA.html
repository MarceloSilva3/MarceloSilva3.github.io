<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>Video and image feeds have actually shown vital for surveillance - but there's space for more performance by using audio. Human beings have 5 senses that collectively allow us to precisely range our environment. For that reason, it only makes sense that a security system that engages as lots of senses as possible is more reliable. And since it's not practical to engage touch, taste, and odor from another location, the most efficient video surveillance systems integrate sight and hearing to improve security protection.</p>
<p>We like that the Argus 2 features a color night vision alternative, however the black and white version can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality footage.
