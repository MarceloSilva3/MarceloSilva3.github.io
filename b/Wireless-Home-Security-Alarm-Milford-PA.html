<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later developed to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.

The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
