<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Renters, unlike homeowners, usually avoid making long-term changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies likewise permit remote control of the system and general home automation.
