<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
