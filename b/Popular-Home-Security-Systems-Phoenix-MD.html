However, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their primary communication source.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've evaluated.

However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

Wireless security systems are a network of sensing units, motion detectors and surveillance cameras that can be set up without professional assistance and are totally mobile.

Most wireless systems likewise deal with your mobile phone, offering you the ability to monitor the system when you're not at home, in addition to do things like change the thermostat or close the garage door from afar. And while professional installation is not needed, there are companies that use wireless security with complete installation if it's not something you want to handle yourself.</p>
