<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual comes to the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic.
