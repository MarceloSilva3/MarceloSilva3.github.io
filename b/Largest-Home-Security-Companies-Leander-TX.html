Wireless security systems are more integratable and agile, however low signal strength and poor connection are still typical complaints.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to attend to the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
