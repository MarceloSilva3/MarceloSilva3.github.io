Throughout testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we enjoy that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensing unit can be adapted to account for pets, too. The alarm is just one of 2 we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're amazed that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further preventing anybody from trying to break in to your home.
