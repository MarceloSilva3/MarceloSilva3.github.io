<p>A wired security system was the very first kind of security system that was invented for house owners. It needs to be set up by an expert alarm installation team and, once set up, is tough to move from one location to another. Wired systems are more typical for big residential or commercial properties and are typically more costly than a wireless home security system. They can consist of outdoor cameras and an indoor camera just like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the team will need to remodel the existing wires in your house. The group will be able to reuse the existing electrical wiring if you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>
