The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies call into question the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of enabling 3 or four totally free false alarms per calendar year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
