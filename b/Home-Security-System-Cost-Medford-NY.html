<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
