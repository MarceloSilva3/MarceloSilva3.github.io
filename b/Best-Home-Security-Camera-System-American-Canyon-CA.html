<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to store and how long you prepare to keep taped footage.
