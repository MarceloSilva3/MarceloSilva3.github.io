<p>Peace of mind does not need to be expensive. Home security systems typically need long contracts and pro installation, however there are smart systems you can install yourself that include a monitoring plan to keep tabs on it-- and just when you want that. We discovered Ring Alarm to be the most cost effective, detailed, and user friendly DIY home security system that has both self-monitoring and professional-monitoring alternatives and does not lock you into a contract.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
