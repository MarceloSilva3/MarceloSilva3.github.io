<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've labeled (after a learning period).
