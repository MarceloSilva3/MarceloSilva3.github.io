<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious attacker, given that the disruption of the network avoids the flow of information and really indirectly safeguards data by avoiding it from being transmitted. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying a chance for the harmful opponent to record these codes and use numerous cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system.
