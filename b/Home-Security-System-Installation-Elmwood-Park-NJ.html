<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
