<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
