<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
