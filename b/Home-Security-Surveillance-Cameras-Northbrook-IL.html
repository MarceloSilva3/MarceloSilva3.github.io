Due to the fact that ADT has more consumers than most brand names-- which indicates it has more opportunities to run into issues, part of that is. But part of it is the way ADT sells its equipment. When a company works with multiple dealerships and suppliers, its clients are going to get a broad variety of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>We also enjoy that Ring still has good clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with wise home devices like lights and locks.
