<h3>Wireless Security Cameras in Princeton WV</h3>

Hardly ever will anyone effort to harm you when they know their actions are being recorded on camera. Cameras keep you and your personal property safe.

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
