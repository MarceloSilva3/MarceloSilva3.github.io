<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
