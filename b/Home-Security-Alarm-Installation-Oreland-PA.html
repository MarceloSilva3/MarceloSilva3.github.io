<h3>Home Security Monitoring Companies in Pennsylvania</h3>

Of our top five, SimpliSafe is the most versatile for the contract-averse. Some brands, like Frontpoint, even let you move your equipment to a new home totally free.</p>
<p>ADT puts your personal privacy first, and we do not offer your individual information. Blue by ADT products use login failure lockout and password strength reinforcement, in addition to encryption technology. With 6.2 million customers, ADT is the most relied on name in home security.

As soon as the cameras were hooked up, we monitored day and night activities, including the comings and goings of 2 grownups, one kid, and a pet. In our testing, we paid particular attention to taping quality and length, frequency of informs, the app geofencing, smart-home, and interface integration.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
