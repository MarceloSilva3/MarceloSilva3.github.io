<h3>Top Home Security Companies in Tennessee</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>SimpliSafe was among the first DIY home security systems to strike shops and is a reasonable alternative to ADT and other expert companies.
