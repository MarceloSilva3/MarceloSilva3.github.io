<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
