Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
