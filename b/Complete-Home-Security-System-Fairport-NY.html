You may even offer guidelines on how to enter into your structure. As just recently as ten years ago, customers did not have access to technology that let them handle their own home security systems. Smart alarm changed that. Originally, standard security systems were hardwired into the home and monitored by a main station, typically a home alarm company. The client paid monthly costs.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense avoidance developed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property crime and can be used in location of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will reduce criminal offense and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
