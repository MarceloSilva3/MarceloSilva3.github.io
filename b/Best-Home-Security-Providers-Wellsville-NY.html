<p>Though the majority of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video technology, it is necessary to note that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly efficient for lots of surveillance applications, especially those on a spending plan. With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local seeing from one main monitoring area.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>
