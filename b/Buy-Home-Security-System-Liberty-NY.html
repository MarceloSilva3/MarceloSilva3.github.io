However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have additional sensing units and crucial fobs, too.</p>
