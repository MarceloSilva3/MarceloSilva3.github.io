<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible wrongdoers are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they think they are being viewed or have a greater threat of being collared. This is also referred to as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity prevention method, which argues that chances to upset can be lowered by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
