<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, however the white and black variation can really be clearer and provide you higher-quality footage. This isn't really a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's cost and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo wise service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a solar panel battery charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level.
