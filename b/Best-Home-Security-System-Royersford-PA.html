<p>Consider it by doing this, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It just does not add up. To offer such low prices, manufacturers must cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance.

There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
