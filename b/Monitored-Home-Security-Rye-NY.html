<h2>Smart Surveillance System Rye</h2>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
