<h2>Smart Surveillance System Rye</h2>
<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over hardwired versus wireless home security systems.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
