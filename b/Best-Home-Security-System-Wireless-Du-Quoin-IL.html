<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, however entries were typically missing, despite appearing in the app's activity timeline.
