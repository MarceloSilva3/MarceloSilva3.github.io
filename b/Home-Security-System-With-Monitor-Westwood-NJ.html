If you purchased cameras prior to 2010 or if you have coax cable (look at the cable behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that means you have standard analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without compromising your coax facilities. That's simply $0.63 a day (or about $19 a month) for the Abode Iota All-in-One security camera, an additional contact sensing unit, and a remote key fob.
