<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
