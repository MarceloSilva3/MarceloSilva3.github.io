<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
