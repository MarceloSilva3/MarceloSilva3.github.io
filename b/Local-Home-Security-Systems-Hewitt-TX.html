<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
