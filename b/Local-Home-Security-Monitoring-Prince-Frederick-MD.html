<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
