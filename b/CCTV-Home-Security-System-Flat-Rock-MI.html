<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
