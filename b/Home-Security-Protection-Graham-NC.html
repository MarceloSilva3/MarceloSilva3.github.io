<p>C. False Alarm System. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. If utilizing 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet, Select either landline or the appropriate interactive service. Select billing duration: Yearly or regular monthly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our annual consumers. This is NOT an agreement, rather a yearly prepay discount. When I ultimately entered the camera controls, I was fairly satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the person being seen understand they're being watched, and you can pick to record video or photos and conserve them to your clever device on an impulse.</p>
