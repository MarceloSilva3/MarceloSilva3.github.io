The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with terrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot.
