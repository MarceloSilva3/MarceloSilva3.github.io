<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was detected. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey.
