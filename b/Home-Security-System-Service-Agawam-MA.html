I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros once again. I extremely recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what offers the video history and smarter signals, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a comparatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 annually) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for 30 days of video history.
