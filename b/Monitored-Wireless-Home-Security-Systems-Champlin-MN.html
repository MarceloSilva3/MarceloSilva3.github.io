<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and mobility. Tenants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be set up at different properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new components too. Wireless security strategies also allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.
