<p>Home security must never ever be restricted by where you can put or power your cameras, indoors or outdoors. From what we've seen, Deep Guard is a clear winner when it concerns proactive home security and putting a stop to criminal activity prior to it occurs.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, because it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi.
