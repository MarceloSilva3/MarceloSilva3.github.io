<p>The real factor cameras are usually deployed is to minimize much pettier crimes. But it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have actually been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have discovered that they have actually not reduced criminal activity. "When the crime and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the basic downward trend in offenses and criminal offenses," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were noted in certain classifications but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had minimized crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British federal government).</p>
