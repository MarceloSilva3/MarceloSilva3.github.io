You'll have three options to pick from, which vary from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance.

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
