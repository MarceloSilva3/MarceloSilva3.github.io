<p>Multiple screens were installed within the new command center with a single monitor designated to alarm screens. Once any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearby camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the direction of the occurrence depends on the preliminary requirements for location of coverage. If there are 3 select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single set camera can just watch one. This develops a one in 3 chance of catching a specific event on video (either live or tape-recorded). The command center also included a computer system designated for filing incident reports online. These can be accessed by management personnel at a later date from a database via the computer network.</p>
