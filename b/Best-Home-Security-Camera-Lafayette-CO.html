<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal worth. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is simpler to use than the other cameras on this list. It likewise does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does provide a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is discovered. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though.

So is the prepare for recordings from several cameras: $10 a month or $100 a year.</p>
